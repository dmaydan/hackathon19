## Overview
The 4th Fruit Fly brain Hackathon (FFBH 2019) will be held on Wednesday, March 20, 2019. The goal of the hackathon is to bring together researchers interested in developing executable models of the fruit fly brain. In this yearâ€™s hackathon, we will focus on the FlyBrainLab (FBL), a newly developed interactive computing platform for studying the function of executable circuits constructed from fly brain data. The hackathon is aimed at three main groups of participants: neurobiologists, modelers and software engineers. We welcome researchers working on the fruit fly brain as well as those working on other model organisms to participate and broaden the discussion in the hackathon.

The Fruit Fly Brain Hackathon 2019 is organized in conjunction with the [Columbia Workshop on Brain Circuit, Memory and Computation](http://fruitflybrain.org/workshops.html) on March 21-22, 2019. Participants of the hackathon are welcome to attend the workshop.

## Computing Resources
Participants only need to bring a laptop to the hackathon to fully explore the capacity of the FFBO. We will host the main FFBO service on an Amazon EC2 instance with limited capacity. For attendees interested in installing FFBO on their own machines, or developing new features, all service packages will be available in the form of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) images. Instructions to install FBL will be provided by March 13, 2019. An Amazon Machine Image will also be provided. We encourage participants to try installing the FBL platform before the hackathon.
